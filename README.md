# GEEQ Authoritative ANL Server

This code runs at [anl.geeq.io](http://anl.geeq.io/) and it keeps track of the list of active nodes on the Geeq network. This server is used primarily by new nodes or nodes on the network that haven't been active for quite some time. Each block on the GeeqChain has the ANL so in most cases, a node can get the most recent ANL from the last block.
